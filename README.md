## Heart Disease Prediction
For this project, I used [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) from Kaggle, which is a combination between 5 different datasets from Cleveland, Budapest, Switzerland, Long Beach VA and Stalog. 

In this dataset, there are 11 clinical features for predicting heart disease events:
1. Age: age of the patient [years]
Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]
MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]
ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]
